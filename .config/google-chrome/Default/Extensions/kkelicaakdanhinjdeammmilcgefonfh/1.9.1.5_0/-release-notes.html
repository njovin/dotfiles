		<b>Hello again!</b><br /><br />

		<b>First of all</b>, I'd like to thank each and every one of those that contacted me today just to let me know they appreciate my work (or even "bought me a coffee").<br />
		<b>Secondly</b>, I want to thank to all of the others who are happily using my extension, but haven't contacted me. Honestly, I don't know how I would have managed to read 200.000 emails in a single day! :)<br />
		<b>Finally</b>, I want to apologize for the sometimes harsh language I'm using when communicating with you all, and also clear the air about something I said in my previous update notes, that seemed to trouble quite a few people!
		<br /><br />
		<q style="font-style: italic;">I could have sold the extension to someone who would have gained access to all your passwords, emails, etc without you even knowing it.</q>
		<br /><br />
		That sounds really bad, especially when taken out of context.
		<br /><br />
		That was not a threat, as some people misunderstood it! Also, I was not giving praise to myself, as others thought...<br />
		I only wanted to re-assure you that <b>your privacy is one of my main concerns when it comes to this extension and I wouldn't ever do anything to put you at risk</b>.
		I probably wouldn't have even thought about bringing it up if someone wouldn't have mentioned it in a review he left in the webstore.<br />
		<br /><br />
		<b>A simple explanation for non-developers is this:</b><br />
		Basically, any extension that is able to interact with a web page by reading or modifying it's content, is able to read anything you enter in web forms,
		from usernames &amp; passwords to credit card details and other sensitive data (basically, any text displayed by your browser - even the stuff you type in password fields).
		The thing is that most extension actually need the ability to interact with pages for legit reasons and it's hard to decide which you should trust and which not.
		As an example from the top of my head, all ad blockers, color pickers, extensions that enable mouse gestures, form auto-completers, password managers (doh!), text highlighters (and the list could go on) have the technical capability to
		silently steal your data without you even suspecting it, if their developer would choose to do so.
		<br /><br />
		<b>As for developers:</b><br />
		Extensions interact with webpages through "content scripts" which are plain JavaScript injected into every page that loads in the browser.
		This means that the extension can read the DOM and attach keypress event handlers to anything and send the captured data anywhere using AJAX calls (yes, extensions can make cross-domain AJAX calls).
		<br /><br />
		(In the case of Window Resizer, a content script is used to create the tooltip shown when you resize the window.)
		<br /><br />
		I know this is really scary stuff; it's the same thing I fear every time I install a new extension myself. I just didn't wanted you to have these fears when it comes to Window Resizer; that's what I meant in my previous notes.
		<br /><br />
		Once again, I'm sorry if I've disappointed you in any way! I hope that clears up the things a bit, but, if you have any other concerns,
		feel free to contact me using the Support link in the webstore or by sending an email at <a href="mailto:ionut.botizan@gmail.com?subject=Window Resizer">ionut.botizan@gmail.com</a>, with the subject "Window Resizer"
		<br /><br />
		<b>Thank you!</b>
		<br /><br />
		<em>P.S.: Instead of just sending me an "Thank you!" email to show your appreciation (or not!), please right click on the extension's icon then click on "Window Resizer". That would open the webstore, where you can leave a review or edit your previous one.<br />
		I'm not asking for 5 stars, I'm asking for your honest opinion, because people looking to install this extension should know all sides of the story, not only the negative comments about how I'm evil and I'm trying to conquer the internets... :)</em>

	<h3>Version 1.9.0.1 <span>(2013-12-12)</span>:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Just a minor update (changed <code>partnerId</code> from 4 to 2).</li>
		<li>...and made it more obvious that there's been an update and people should read these notes!</li>
		<li>
			Anyways, I don't know why I bothered writing these update notes since nobody seems to read them...
			If you're one of those that are reading, thank you for staying informed on the development of this extension!<br />
			It seems to me that the sintagm "Don't make me think" (heavily promoted by [A_BIG_WHITE_SHINY_BRAND] in the last few years) has made people ...dumber(?).
			Everyone expects everything to "just work" as they'd like it to, without any thinking involved on their part...
			<br /><br />
			Just think about it: I could have sold the extension to someone who would have gained access to all your passwords, emails, etc without you even knowing it. I haven't done that! Instead:<br />
			* I chose to keep control on what "advertising" is shown to you and it's something that supports a good cause...<br />
			* I chose something that wouldn't alter the end result of your searches or add bloated ads to any page...<br />
			* I chose something that I control the source code of and also allow you to view it too if you wish to do so...<br />
			* I chose something that doesn't collect any more data than what Google's Analytics service is already collecting about your searches and shares with their partners...<br />
			* I chose something that you can disable if it really bothers you that much!<br />
			<br />
			To all of those that understand the above, THANK YOU!

		<li>
			Added some <a href="keyboard.html">keyboard shorcuts</a>. <b>PLEASE</b> read the notes carefully!
			<br /><br />
			Since Chrome doesn't allow registering extension commands on the fly (when you add/remove presets),
			I only added shortcuts for the first 10 presets in your list, whichever those may be. That should cover most people's basic needs...

		<li style="margin-top:20px; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.6em">
			Again, shooting in the dark, as the messages like <i>"The last update broke the extension... Fix it!"</i> were extremely helpful! :|
			<br /><br />
			Please try next time to provide stuff like extension version, browser version, operating system name and version,
			maybe the config for a preset that you clicked on and froze the extension, your other settings, the type of page that you have opened (local file, http:// page, etc.; in a normal window, popup window)
			<br /><br />
			You never know! Those things might probably come in handy when trying to figure out what the problem was...
			<br />
			Just saying that nothing works isn't helpful because, guess what? <b>Everything works for me!</b> Believe it or not, I test it before publishing a new version so,

		</li>
		<li>
			Added option to center window on screen when resized.

</div>

<div class="release">
	<h3>Version 1.6.1 <span>(2011-03-30)</span>:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Improved mechanism for resizing the viewport. Previously, if the window was maximized when trying to resize the viewport, there was a bug that
			caused the extension to set negative values for the width and height, and the window ended being 0 pixels wide.
		</li>
		<li>
			The extension now needs the permission to access the content on all pages.
			This is required in order for the extension's option to resize just the viewport to work in the latest Chrome dev releases.
			<br /><br />
			<strong>Technical info:</strong>
			<br />
			In order to resize the viewport, the extension needs to know the size of the window's borders, but, unfortunetly, this isn't available through the API.
			So, in order to determine the borders' size, the extension reads the width and height of the actual window, then it takes a screenshot of the
			visible area of the current tab and it substracts the size of the generated image from the window's size.
			<br />
			Unfortunetly, the latest dev versions of Chrome require the extension to ask for permission to access the content of any given tab in order for it
			to be able to take a screenshot of that tab using the API and that's why it stopped working.
		</li>

	</ul>

<div class="release">
	<h3>Version 1.6.0 <span>(2010-10-05)</span>:</h3>
	<ul>

			Added the option to use the current window's position.<br />
			Check "Use current window position" and move the window to the desired location on the screen
			to update the Left/Top values.

			<br />
			Many thanks to <strong>Paul H.</strong> for the suggestions! ;)
		</li>
		<li>
			Added a way to export your settings so you can import them in another (Chrome) browser.
			This way, you can easily copy your settings from your home computer to your office or whatever... :)

<div class="release">
	<h3>Version 1.4.4 <span>(2010-09-14)</span>:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Fixed some bug with adding/editing resolutions.<br />
			When adding resolutions, the script failed to assign a unique ID and if you tried to edit any of those
			the script would assign the new values to all the new resolutions in the list.<br />
			However, the settings were saved correctly and if you closed the settings page and opened it again, the resolutions list
			would display correctly.<br />
			Thanks to <strong>Nate Jr. (n8)</strong> for taking the time to report this bug!

<div class="release">
	<h3>Version 1.4.3 <span>(2010-08-22)</span>:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Fixed issue with window size overlay appearing on printed pages.<br />
			Thanks to user <strong>juliog</strong> for reporting it and also providing a solution to the problem!
		</li>
		<li>
			The extension will try to detect if the current page is a view-source page or a media file (image, mp3, video, etc.)
			before trying to insert the window size overlay in the bottom-right corner.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>NOTE FOR WEBSITES DEVELOPERS</strong><br />
			Users <strong>Vinz</strong> and <strong>Ryan</strong> also reported an issue related not only to this extension,
			but to all extensions (E.g.: MeasureIt) that are using extension specific content scripts (scripts that are altering the DOM
			or adding CSS/JS to the page to perform certain functions; E.g.: overlays).<br />
			As far as I can tell, this issue appears on websites using the <code>head:first-child + body</code> CSS selector to apply certain
			styles only on some browsers.<br />
			The problem is that Chrome (wrongly) inserts a &lt;style&gt; tag right before the &lt;head&gt; (instead of inside) to add those content scripts,
			making the aforementioned CSS selector useless (and breaking your page if you're using it) since &lt;head&gt; is not the first-child anymore...
